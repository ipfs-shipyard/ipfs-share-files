      "copy": "IPFS Share is a simple, free way to share files without needing to rely on services run by big corporations. Instead, it uses the peer-to-peer IPFS protocol for sharing directly between devices. IPFS is built around content addressing — keeping track of files based on what they contain, not where they're located — which means that files can't be modified without changing their addresses too. In other words, when you download a file using IPFS, you can be sure that it's exactly the same as the sender intended.",

      "copy": "It's easy to share these files with someone else by making your device part of the IPFS network. All you need to do is keep this page open; by doing so, your device becomes a node on the network and makes those files available directly to others. Then, share the link that you received — and be sure to keep this page open until you know your recipient has downloaded the files.",

Because IPFS is a public network, when you share content using IPFS Share, you're enabling anyone who knows the unique CID in your share link to retrieve it. This means you should avoid sharing sensitive files or copyrighted material.",

      "copy": "Content identifiers (CIDs) are cryptographically generated fingerprints that allow IPFS to find and deliver files. Because IPFS identifies files by what they contain, not where they're located, a CID points not only to a particular file, but also a specific version — if the file is modified, the CID changes too. When you share a file using IPFS Share, you can see its CID by looking in the share link for the long string of characters starting with \"bafy\".",
