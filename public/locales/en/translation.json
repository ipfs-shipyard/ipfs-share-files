      "copy": "IPFS Share is a simple, free way to share files without needing to rely on services run by big corporations. Instead, it uses the peer-to-peer IPFS protocol for sharing directly between devices. IPFS is built around content addressing — keeping track of files based on what they contain, not where they're located — which means that files can't be modified without changing their addresses too. In other words, when you download a file using IPFS, you can be sure that it's exactly the same as the sender intended.",

All you need to do is keep this page open; by doing so, your device becomes a node on the network and makes those files available directly to others. Then, share the link that you received — and be sure to keep this page open until you know your recipient has downloaded the files.",
